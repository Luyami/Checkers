# Checkers
An open source 10x10 checkers game to be played on console!

# How to play
First, you'll have to choose the pieces which are going to start the game ('B' for the down-side pieces and 'C' for the up-side pieces)

When game starts, your moves must be in this exact format: __<START_COLUMN><START_ROW>--<TOGO_COLUMN><TOGO_ROW>__

# Purpose
It's a university project (the reason why comments are in portuguese and not in english), that's all (:

Feel free to use, modify or even make a whole different game using the source code
