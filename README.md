# Checkers
An open source 10x10 checkers game to be played on terminal!

# How to play
First, you'll have to choose the pieces which are going to start the game ('B' for the down-side pieces and 'C' for the up-side pieces)

When game starts, your moves must be in this exact format: 

__<START_COLUMN><START_ROW>--<TOGO_COLUMN><TOGO_ROW>__ (__Example: A7--B6__)

# Auto-Play mode
If you pass a file as a command-line argument when executing the game, it starts in Auto-Play mode

This mode executes all movements described in the file (Check example in example.txt file)

# Purpose
It's a university project (the reason why comments are in portuguese and not in english), that's all (:

Feel free to use, modify or even make a whole different game using the source code
